I aim to combine visual arts and music, particularly rock, by transforming the feelings and meanings I experience while listening to my favorite songs into paintings. My process involves visualizing the vague images or sensations that arise in my mind as the music plays.
I began this journey with "White Rabbit" by Jefferson Airplane. This song, released in the 1967, is closely linked to "Alice in Wonderland," mainly depicting the transformation of Alice when she took the pills/mushrooms and became bigger/smaller. As to me this’s a trial to break the rationalism.
But why the rabbit? You may wonder about the absence of animals in my initial piece. That's where my second painting comes in, which features a white rabbit as the central figure. Rabbits symbolize speed, impulsiveness, and a certain naiveté, reminiscent of themes also found in Pink Floyd's "Breathe."
Here in my second picture, you can see the rabbit being beckoned by a large hand. The identity of this figure is not crucial. I've titled this piece after Pixies' "Here Comes Your Man" in 1989. While the lyrics convey a message of a brave man in love, my focus is on balancing the intense red background with the song's feeling of imbalance and vulnerability to bring out the sense of absurdity.
Gonna be more in the future.
